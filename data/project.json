    "description": "The purpose of this project is to provide annotations that give viewers additional context about the clips featured in the Say Brother/Basic Black Special Collection trailer and to direct them to the full programs from which the excerpts were taken. At the American Archive of Public Broadcasting, we create trailers to introduce our curated audiovisual special collections. The Say Brother/Basic Black collection launched in June 2025, offers public access to just under a thousand episodes, episode segments, and interviews from GBH’s longest-running public affairs television program produced by, for, and about the Black community. Using highlights from this collection, AAPB Digital Outreach Manager Nick Raineri edited a promotional video to showcase the material. Through this annotation effort, we aim to enrich viewer understanding and help audiences more easily discover the full breadth of the collection.",
