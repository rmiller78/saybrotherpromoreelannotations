In this season premiere television and radio commentator Callie Crossley hosts a LIVE roundtable discussion about what was called the most important presidential race in US history. Guests including Massachusetts State Representative Linda Dorcena Forry, former ABC News anchor and senior correspondent Carole Simpson, Peniel Joseph, associate professor of Africana Studies at Brandeis University, and Howard Manly, executive editor of the Bay State Banner, weigh in on the campaigns of Senators Barack Obama and John McCain and make a pre-election analysis on why voters might gravitate toward either candidate when they go to the polls on Tuesday, Nov. 4. Who speaks to the hearts and pockets of African Americans about a shrinking economy and the impact it has had on struggling families, employment, and the sectors of banking, housing, and education? Our guests explore the greatest issues of concern to the Black community and which problems will be the most important for the next administration to tackle. Also, does Obama's successful primary bid for the presidency symbolize that America is on the cusp of a new era of Black political leadership, one that is not driven by a race-based agenda but is anchored in American solidarity? \n\n\n"

With archival photographs and artwork, interviews with historians, and discussions with the descendants of prominent black Bostonians, BASIC BLACK shows viewers a world rarely seen in history books. Judge Julian Houston tells BASIC BLACK how the African American community in Boston in the 1800s was influential in politics, in the abolitionist movement, and in the fight to desegregate Massachusetts schools. Mario Valdes, a researcher, brings Steven Ellis to the Museum of Fine Arts to show him a portrait of his great-great grandmother, Elizabeth. Ellis is a descendent of Samuel Copeland, a wealthy black merchant who ran a successful used clothing store near Haymarket. Not only did Copeland marry a white woman--an Irish immigrant--his family had several white English and Irish servants. BASIC BLACK also interviews Franklin A. Dorman, author of Twenty Families of Color in Massachusetts, and Lena Reddick, descendent of one of those families. Reddick's ancestor, John T. Hilton, was the most prominent and influential black abolitionist of his era and was close friends with abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison. Reddick talks about her pride in learning of her family's prominent place in Boston history and in sharing that history with her daughter."

Much has been written about the importance of sibling relationships: as our first relationships with peers, they are where we learn to be friends, to share, to negotiate. Basic Black explores sibling relationships in black families by sharing the joys and struggles of two sets of sisters from different eras. Nicole and Shelley Stark, both in their 30s, talk about the intensity of their relationship and how their closeness has ebbed and flowed through the years. Nicole, who lives in Chestnut Hill and is younger than Shelley by five years, talks to Basic Black about Shelley's big-sister role and how she continually struggles to make her own way in the world. The O'Banyoun sisters--Eleanor Collins, Margaret Jackson, and Muriel Walker, all in their 80s--share the perspective of eight decades of sisterhood. They grew up in a time, they say, when families in general were closer than they are today. The three sisters have always lived within a few miles of each other in Roxbury and Dorchester, and see each other regularly. They talk to Basic Black about sibling rivalry and how the deaths of their other sisters have impacted family dynamics."
